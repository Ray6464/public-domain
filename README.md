This Repo has Public Domain Stuff I really Like

## Fonts
All fonts in this Repo are Public Domain, and in **ttf** format.
To install them in Linux Distros witht the following procedure:
1. Copy the `ttf` files in `~/.local/share/fonts`. If this directory doesn't exits make it.
2. Use `fc-cache -f -v` to refeesh font cache.
